# Day 1: Real-Time Neural Signal Processing Pipeline
**Date:** February 28, 2025  
**Author:** Adam Kadwory  

## Overview
A scalable, secure, low-latency system to process neural signals (e.g., EEG, brain implants) in real time. Ingests multi-sensor data, preprocesses on embedded hardware, runs ML inference for intent classification, and delivers outputs to mission-critical applications (e.g., prosthetics). Designed for high performance and reliability—think Neuralink-scale neural decoding.

## Requirements
- **Throughput:** 10k samples/sec per channel (scalable to 100+ channels).
- **Latency:** <10ms end-to-end (ingestion to output).
- **Accuracy:** >95% intent classification.
- **Uptime:** 99.99% with fault tolerance.
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption for sensitive neural data.

## Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - **Tech:** Kafka for scalability, UDP fallback for ultra-low latency on embedded nodes.
   - **Details:** Streams multi-sensor inputs (EEG, EMG) at 10k Hz. Partitioned by channel for parallel processing.
   - **Scale:** Handles 100+ channels via horizontal partitioning.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - **Tech:** C++ on embedded edge nodes (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson), Flink for cloud fallback.
   - **Details:** Real-time FFT, noise filtering, and normalization. Edge latency <5ms; cloud backup for overflow.
   - **Why Embedded?** Minimizes latency and bandwidth—my telematics experience at play.

3. **ML Inference**  
   - **Tech:** TensorRT on GPUs (cloud) or Jetson (edge), Kubernetes for orchestration.
   - **Details:** Lightweight CNN (e.g., 1M params) for intent classification. Load-balanced across replicas.
   - **Trade-off:** 95% accuracy vs. <10ms inference—optimized via quantization.

4. **Output Delivery**  
   - **Tech:** gRPC API with redundant endpoints.
   - **Details:** Sub-millisecond responses to downstream systems (e.g., robotic actuators). Protobuf for efficiency.

5. **Monitoring & Security**  
   - **Tech:** Prometheus + Grafana, TLS encryption.
   - **Details:** Tracks latency, drift, and uptime. Secure data flow (HIPAA/GDPR-ready)—my safety-critical focus.

## Diagram
[See architecture-diagram.txt]  
- Flow: Ingestion (Kafka/UDP) → Preprocessing (Edge/Cloud) → Inference (TensorRT/K8s) → Output (gRPC) → Monitoring.

## Trade-Offs
- **Edge vs. Cloud:** Edge cuts latency (<5ms) but limits scale; cloud scales infinitely but adds 2-3ms.
- **Accuracy vs. Speed:** Quantized model sacrifices 1-2% accuracy for 3x faster inference.
- **Cost:** Embedded nodes are pricier upfront but reduce cloud dependency.

## Why It’s Impressive
- Real-time (<10ms) ML on multi-sensor neural data.
- Embedded + cloud hybrid for flexibility—my bioengineering edge.
- Secure, fault-tolerant design for mission-critical use—think prosthetics or defense.

## Pseudocode
- `pseudocode/preprocessing.cpp`: Edge-based signal filtering.
- `pseudocode/inference.py`: TensorRT inference loop.

## Next Steps
Tune for 1000 channels? Swap CNN for transformers? Let me know what you think!
