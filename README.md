# 30-Day System Design Challenge
**Turning Complex Problems into Elegant Solutions**  
Welcome to my 30-Day System Design Challenge—12+ advanced, real-world architectures blending bioengineering, machine learning, and scalable systems.  

I’m a bioengineer passionate about **ML, embedded systems, and real-time processing**, with hands-on experience in AI-driven analytics, multi-sensor integration, and mission-critical applications (think autonomous tech and brain-machine interfaces). Over the next 30 days, I’m sharing my playbook with **twice-weekly designs** across two tracks:  

- **`specialized-designs`**: Cutting-edge systems from my work in brain-machine interfaces, telematics, and autonomy.  
- **`general-designs`**: Scalable, big-tech-ready solutions for distributed ML and beyond.  

Join me to explore, critique, or contribute—let’s push the limits of AI and hardware together!  
**First Design:** Feb 28, 2025 | **[LinkedIn: Adam Kadwory](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-kadwory90/)** | **Next Up:** Mar 4, 2025
