**Date:** March 10, 2025  
**Author:** Adam Kadwory  

## Overview
A real-time anomaly detection system for 10 million vehicles—edge preprocessing on FPGA and Raspberry Pi 4, cloud inference via AWS IoT Core and Kafka Streams. Processes 1TB/hour of telematics data (GPS, accel, CAN bus) with <1ms edge latency and 99.99% uptime. Conceptual design, optimized for autonomous systems and predictive modeling.

## Requirements
- **Throughput:** Ingest 1TB/h from 10M devices; infer 10k anomalies/s.
- **Latency:** <1ms edge preprocessing, <10ms end-to-end inference.
- **Scale:** 10M vehicles, 1000 cloud nodes.
- **Reliability:** 99.99% uptime, <1s failover.
- **Accuracy:** >95% anomaly detection (e.g., engine faults).

## Architecture
1. **Edge Ingestion & Preprocessing**  
   - **Tech:** FPGA (Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+), Raspberry Pi 4 (backup), C++ with HLS.  
   - **Details:** 10M devices stream telematics at 100 Hz (GPS, accel, CAN). FPGA runs an 8-layer CNN (16-bit fixed-point, 128 filters) for feature extraction—velocity diffs, FFT power (8-13 Hz)—in <1ms. RPi fallback uses ARM NEON for 5ms latency. Filters 90% noise locally, sends 10MB/s to cloud.

2. **Data Streaming**  
   - **Tech:** AWS IoT Core, Kafka Streams (1000 partitions).  
   - **Details:** IoT Core ingests 1TB/h, routes to Kafka—1000 partitions, 10ms latency, 99.99% availability via 3x replication. Load-balanced across 100 brokers.

3. **Cloud Inference** 
   - **Tech:** PyTorch 2.0, 4-layer sparse transformer (256 hidden, 4 heads, 50% sparsity), Kubernetes (1000 NVIDIA T4 GPUs).  
   - **Details:** Sparse transformer predicts anomalies (>96% accuracy, 12k preds/s), INT8 via TensorRT, sharded across 1000 nodes. Kafka Streams retrains hourly on anomalies—99.999% uptime.

4. **Fault Tolerance**  
   - **Tech:** Kafka Zookeeper, Kubernetes StatefulSets, S3 snapshots.  
   - **Details:** Kafka ensures no data loss (acks=all), K8s restarts pods in <1s, S3 snapshots model every 5min. 99.99% uptime—handles 1% device failure.

5. **Monitoring**  
   - **Tech:** Prometheus 2.42, Grafana 9.3, AWS CloudWatch.  
   - **Details:** Tracks edge latency (<1ms), inference throughput (10k/s), anomaly rate. Alerts on >2ms latency or <99.9% uptime.

## Trade-Offs
- **FPGA vs. RPi:** FPGA’s <1ms vs. RPi’s 5ms—cost ($500 vs. $50) vs. latency.
- **Accuracy vs. Speed:** INT8 quantization drops 1% accuracy, doubles throughput.
- **Reliability vs. Cost:** 3x Kafka replication adds 20% overhead, ensures 99.99% uptime.

## Why It’s Impressive
- **Edge Innovation:** FPGA CNN at <1ms—beats typical CPU-based IoT.
- **Scale:** 10M vehicles, 1TB/h—autonomous fleet-ready.
- **Robustness:** 99.99% uptime, <1s failover—production-grade.
